# API Integration Fix - Deployment Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Issue:** API endpoints not working on curations.dev
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Ready for deployment

---

## Problem Statement

When users interacted with curations.dev:
- Vote buttons did nothing
- Idea submissions failed
- No API responses in network tab
- 404 errors on `/api/*` endpoints

**Impact:** Complete loss of interactive functionality across the site.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was architectural:

1. **Cloudflare Pages** was serving the static Astro site
2. **Cloudflare Worker** was deployed separately with API logic
3. **No routing connection** between Pages and Worker
4. API requests to `/api/*` were handled by Pages (which had no API handlers)
5. Result: 404 errors on all API endpoints

## Solution Implemented

### Approach: Cloudflare Pages Functions

Instead of trying to route from Pages to a separate Worker, we implemented the API directly in Pages using **Cloudflare Pages Functions**.

**Benefits:**
- Single deployment (no separate Worker needed)
- Unified domain (curations.dev for everything)
- Simpler configuration
- Direct KV access
- Better integration

### Technical Changes

#### 1. Routing Configuration (`public/_routes.json`)
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "include": ["/*"],
  "exclude": ["/api/*"]
}
```
- Static routes served from `dist/`
- API routes handled by Functions

#### 2. API Handler (`functions/api/[[path]].ts`)
- Handles all `/api/*` endpoints
- Uses KV namespaces for data storage
- Includes CORS headers
- Proper error handling
- 242 lines of TypeScript

#### 3. Worker Updates (`cloudflare/worker.ts`)
- Added CORS headers to all responses
- Improved error handling
- Consistent JSON responses
- Can still be deployed standalone (optional)

#### 4. Documentation Suite
Created 9 comprehensive documentation files:
- API fix guide
- KV setup instructions
- Deployment checklist
- Architecture overview
- Quick start guide
- And more...

## Files Changed

- ✅ `docs/PAGES_KV_SETUP.md`
- ✅ `docs/POST_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
- ✅ `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Deployment Requirements

### CRITICAL: KV Bindings Must Be Configured

After deploying to Cloudflare Pages, you MUST configure KV bindings:

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Workers & Pages → curations-community
3. Settings → Functions → KV namespace bindings
4. Add bindings:
   - `CURATIONS_VOTES` → your votes namespace
   - `CURATIONS_IDEAS` → your ideas namespace

**Without this step, APIs will return 500 errors.**

See [`docs/PAGES_KV_SETUP.md`](docs/PAGES_KV_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

## Testing Plan

Follow [`docs/POST_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/POST_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) for complete testing.

**Quick Tests:**

```bash
# 1. Check API responds
curl https://curations.dev/api/votes

# 2. Test vote submission
curl -X POST https://curations.dev/api/vote \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":"test-1"}'

# 3. Test idea submission
curl -X POST https://curations.dev/api/idea \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test","description":"Testing","categories":["test"]}'
```

**Browser Tests:**
1. Visit https://curations.dev/projects
2. Click a vote button → count should increment
3. Visit https://curations.dev/ideas
4. Submit a new idea → should appear in list

## Security Review

✅ **CodeQL Scan:** 0 vulnerabilities found
✅ **CORS:** Properly configured for API access
✅ **Input Validation:** All endpoints validate input
✅ **Error Handling:** No information leakage
✅ **Dependencies:** No new dependencies added

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Linting passes (biome)
- [x] Build succeeds (Astro)
- [x] Security scan passes (CodeQL)
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Testing instructions provided
- [ ] **KV bindings configured** (post-deployment)
- [ ] **End-to-end testing** (post-deployment)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Immediate:** Revert to previous deployment
   - Cloudflare Dashboard → Deployments
   - Click "..." on previous deployment → Rollback

2. **Alternative:** Remove bindings temporarily
   - Disables API but keeps static site working
   - Settings → Functions → Remove bindings

3. **Full Rollback:** Revert Git commits
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD~3..HEAD
   git push
   ```

## Performance Expectations

**Static Pages:**
- Load time: <500ms
- Cached: Yes (CDN)
- Global: 275+ locations

**API Functions:**
- Response time: 50-200ms
- Cached: No (executes every time)
- Execution: Edge (near user)

**KV Storage:**
- Read: <10ms typically
- Write: Immediate local, ~60s global
- Consistency: Eventual

## Known Limitations

1. **KV Write Limit:** 1,000/day on free plan
   - Impact: Heavy voting might hit limit
   - Solution: Upgrade to paid plan if needed

2. **Forum Requires Paid Plan:** Durable Objects need Workers Paid
   - Current: Forum endpoints return 503
   - Future: Enable when upgraded

3. **Eventual Consistency:** Vote counts may lag 1-2 minutes globally
   - Expected behavior
   - Not a bug

## Next Steps

### Immediately After Merge

1. ✅ Merge PR
2. ✅ Verify GitHub Actions deployment succeeds
3. ⚠️ Configure KV bindings (CRITICAL)
4. ✅ Redeploy to pick up bindings
5. ✅ Run test checklist

### Within 24 Hours

1. Monitor Functions logs for errors
2. Check KV namespace contents
3. Verify vote counts incrementing
4. Test from multiple devices/locations

### Within 1 Week

1. Review analytics for usage patterns
2. Check for any error patterns
3. Optimize if needed
4. Document any issues found

## Support Resources

   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior

## Success Metrics

**How to know it's working:**

✅ API endpoints return JSON (not 404)
✅ Vote buttons increment counts
✅ Idea submissions create new ideas
✅ No errors in browser console
✅ No 500 errors in Functions logs
✅ KV namespaces show data

**If any of these fail, see troubleshooting in [`docs/API_INTEGRATION_FIX.md`](docs/API_INTEGRATION_FIX.md)**
